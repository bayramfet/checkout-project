-  User stories;

   - When I click plus button on product's row, I can increase the product's quantity.
   - When I click minus button on product's row, I can decrease the product's quantity, but minimum quantity value can be 1.
   - When I click remove button on product's row, I can delete a product in the cart.
   - When I change any combination of product chart(plus, minus, remove etc.), I want to see the new calculation of chart's prices in concerned fields.

ðŸ”¥ You donâ€™t need to create a new html template in this project, you can use [Checkout_Page](https://github.com/clarusway/clarusway-full-stack-tr-12-22/tree/main/html-css/projects/005-checkout-form)  template. We will be concerned in javascript side.
